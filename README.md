Purpose of the app: This travel blog app was created to provide an opportunity for individuals to record their travel experiences in the United States. The App is also targeting individuals who plan on traveling in the United States. With the help of this app, individuals can read our blogs for information about different travel locations in the U.S.

How to use: Our app has two authentication interfaces; one is for users and the other one is for guests. Users can register by simply creating a username and password to login to our website. Afterwards, they can immediately start blogging about their own vacation experiences. A user will be able to immediately post a blog after logging into our app and see the blog they posted on their profile page.

A guest can browse our travel blogs without registering any information. They can sort through the blogs in either the newest or oldest order. They can also leave a comment for each blog on the author’s profile page. Our guests can make informed decisions before traveling to their vacation designation after they get information from the blogs viewed.

In the admin interface, we are able to monitor the blogs for any material that is not appropriate. We also have the ability to ensure that every password is encrypted in a hash format when the user inserts their information into the database. Every user’s information is also authenticated when they login before any pages such as “posting a blog” or their “profile page” is rendered. 

Features on the app: The app is featured with creative designs and functionalities that include buttons, date and time registration, comment box, guest registration and blog box. The contributors created this app using full server-side pages. This included implementing some server side pages hybrid using the static resources to provide certain functionalities such as leaving a comment and sorting the blog to display in the oldest and newest order. We also used Postgres SQL CRUD operation for our database. 

Programs: JavaScript, Mustache-Express, CSS, Nodejs, and Sequelize.
